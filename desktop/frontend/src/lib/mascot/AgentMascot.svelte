  // An agent, drawn as the mascot — the robot with the agent's own `icon:` on
  // its ears and the hue its name gives it (or the one its file names).
  //
  // This is the frame the cartoon person (until 12 ก.ย. 2026) stood in, kept
  // to its contract on purpose: a name in, a face out, `state`
  // in the card's five words, `off` for one the assistant may not hand work
  // to, `size` in pixels. Seven surfaces drew that person — the office, the
  // delegate card in the chat, the background panel, ห้องความสามารถ, งานวิดีโอ,
  // the settings roster and its editor — and every one of them replaced it by
  // changing one import line. Anything the cartoon had that the mascot does
  // not (hair, glasses) is simply not a prop here; anything the mascot has
  // that the cartoon did not (shell, top, face) is one, off the same profile
  // row (agentLook.ts).
  //
  // Role is always `assistant` — COMPANY.md §6, one face: an agent is the
  // assistant's template wearing its own badge, not a second character.
  //
  // Motion follows the card, not the tile. A roster of twenty breathing
  // together is a page that stutters (MASCOT.md §3.7), so by default the
  // mascot is still — except while its state says the job is alive (`think`,
  // `work`), which is when the cartoon person moved too and when the eye is
  // on it. A caller may say `still` either way.
