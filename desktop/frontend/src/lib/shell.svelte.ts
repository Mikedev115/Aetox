// The two doors (COMPANY.md §2, DECISIONS §86): Aetox ผู้ช่วย and Aetox โค้ด.
//
// A shell is which storefront the window is showing, and it decides one thing
// only: which of the five rooms are drawn. It is *not* a second app — one
// binary, one engine, one DataRoot, one identity — and it is not engine state
// either, which is why it lives here beside the theme rather than in the
// cockpit: the engine never needs to know which door you walked in through.
// What the engine knows is the desk a session was opened at, and that is
// already `sessions.mode`.
//
// Persisted like the theme, and for the same reason: people use one door for
// days at a time, so reopening the app on the other one reads as the app
// forgetting who you are.

// A door takes its *name* from the desk behind it — same key the room button
// uses, because it is the same word and two spellings of one name is how they
// drift apart.
//
// Its *line* is not the desk's description, and the difference is not
// pedantry. A manifest description answers "what can this desk do", is read in
// Settings beside a tool list, and is as long as being accurate requires. A
// door sign answers "which half of the product is this" for someone holding a
// mouse, and every word past about five costs more than it earns. Binding the
// menu to the manifest was tried and read as a wall of text; these are three
// words each, on purpose, and they are not a duplicate of anything.
